# Basic-Portfolio

This is a wesbite meant to represent the basic outline of a portfolio website.
It includes three primary pages:
- An index page, which also houses the "about me" content.
- A contact page, which features a form that can be filled out.  As of right now, the form doesn't effectively submit the text to a location.
- A portfolio page, that will link to other projects that I've built.  I've not yet completed additional projects to add to that inventory.  This page will be updated as projects are completed.

The general layout of the site includes a navigation bar as well as a "sticky footer" that are positioned at the top and bottom of each page, respectively.
